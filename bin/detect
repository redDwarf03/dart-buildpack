The Dart buildpack is set on this application, but was
unable to detect a 'pubspec.yaml' file. This is likely because
the '.slugignore' file is removing it before the build begins.

The Dart buildpack is set on this application, but was

Application not supported by Dart buildpack

The Dart buildpack is set on this application, but was
unable to detect a Dart codebase.

A Dart app on Scalingo requires a 'pubspec.yaml' at the root of
the directory structure.

If you are trying to deploy a Dart application, ensure that this
file is present at the top level directory. This directory has the
following files:

$(ls -1p "$1")

If you are trying to deploy an application written in another
language, you need to change the list of buildpacks used to deploy
this application.

For more information, refer to the following documentation:
